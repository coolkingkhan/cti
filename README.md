Front-end Challenge

I have been provided a designed homepage of an ecommerce website, and my task is to build this page.

The tools and technologies i have chosen to implement this task are as follows, with a brief description next to each.

gruntjs Yeoman Scaffolding with assemble - A very quick front-end templating system which enables me to start coding straight away. It came with foundation as a default, which i uninstalled as i wanted a clean start.

I installed and configured grunt-autoprefixer seperately which does not come with the above, making sure that i added this in the gruntfile as and where needed.

The purpose of this challenge is to provide insight into my development skills and problem solving capabilities.
